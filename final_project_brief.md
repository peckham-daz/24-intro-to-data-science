#### How will we mark your work?
Your work will be marked according to UAL Level 7 (MSc) assessment criteria. If you have any questions, please ask your tutor for clarification.<br>

You will be given a mark of "A", "B" (if the project meets the Advanced criteria), or a "pass", with verbal feedback.

#### When to expect feedback by
You can expect feedback within 2 weeks of your submission deadline.<br><br>

#### Adjusted deadline
If you're eligible for the adjusted deadline, please email your personal tutor directly and CC the Programme Leader (Marysia).<br><br>

#### You're eligible for the adjusted deadline if:
- you are disabled, have a learning difficulty, or are neurodiverse,
- unexpected circumstances out of your control impacted your work on the final project (for example: illness, family situation, broken computer).
<br><br>
#### Late submissions:
- submissions up to 7 days late will get a lower mark.
- later submissions will be capped to a "pass" and may receive delayed feedback. Projects submitted more than 2 weeks after the deadline will be marked at the tutor's discretion.

### Project specification

#### 1. The Python Data Science project:
- Example website topics:
  - visualise, analyse and describe a selected dataset found online,
  - create your own dataset using web scraping techniques or a selected web API and describe it.
  - manually create a dataset and present insights into it using Python programming techniques.
  - it may (but does not have to) refer to one of themes of the Southwark Economic Strategy 2023-30 (https://www.southwark.gov.uk/business/southwark-economic-strategy),
  - another topic that allows you to demonstrate the skills listed in this Final Project Brief.
- The code should be available online on GitHub and consist mostly of .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) and .py (Python script) files.
- You can edit the code from class for a "pass", or merge, different files and look for your own resources for an Advanced project ("A" or "B")
<br><br>
#### 2. Project report:
- it should include:
  - a description of your data, its source, and collection method if applicable,
  - a reflection on representation and biases in the dataset and potential consequences,
  - what you learnt during working on the project,
  - what challenges you encountered in the process and how you approached them,
  - what went well in your project,
  - what you would do differently if working on a similar challenge in the future.
  - an ethical statement including your take on the data, its sources, biases, and potential uses of your project,
- it should be submitted in writing (.pdf, .docx, .odt, or .md file) nad available in the GitHub repository.
<br><br>

#### 3. Links or files of exercises from class or homework developed throughout the course.
- these can be links to online coding platforms or links to code files shared elsewhere online.
<br><br>
#### 4. The optional supplementary materials can include:
- a different or work-in-progress versions of the project,
- documentation of your learning process and exercises,
- any other supporting documentation.
