    "- API stands for **Application Programming Interface**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the context of Python, APIs are used to request and receive data from web servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specifically a **REST API** is a type of online service that we can access to receiver (and send) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficient and structured way to access data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Less prone to breaking than web scraping - data is served in standard formats like JSON.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Allows third-party interaction with other services e.g social media, weather apps etc"
